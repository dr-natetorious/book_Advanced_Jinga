Project Objective: Create an advanced book about jinga2 templates for seasoned senior engineers. Use solutions based chapters that focus on teaching best practices.

Requirements:

- The reader is me an advanced developers that already use jinga. We use it for platform development, code generation, web dev with fastapi, site reliability. Python is our default language.

- Include enough chapters to cover a broad set of use cases, patterns, and problems. After creating the TOC I have Claude generate specific sections that are interesting within the projects and artifact ui.
